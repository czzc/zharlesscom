    { one: "Hey, I'm a full-stack developer based out of southwestern Virginia, who lives somewhere between clean design and chaotic late-night debugging sessions. I've worked across the stack—building interfaces, wiring up APIs, and coaxing backend services into doing what they're supposed to." },
    { two: "I like building things that are actually useful—and don't break when you look at them funny. Whether it's crafting clean code, untangling spaghetti logic, or pretending semicolons are optional, I'm here for it." },
    { three: "Always learning, always improving—and occasionally Googling the same error for the 48th time."}
