  bio: [
    `Hey, I'm a full-stack developer out of southwestern Virginia. I live somewhere between a love for clean design and the chaos of fixing bugs at 2AM. I've worked all over the stack—building UI, wiring up APIs, and convincing backend services to behave (mostly).`,
    `I like making things that are actually useful—and don't fall apart the moment someone breathes on them. Clean code? Love it. Spaghetti logic? Bring it on. Semicolons? I'll use them... probably.`,
    `Always learning, usually tinkering, and yes— Googling errors like it's a tradition.`
